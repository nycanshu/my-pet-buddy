# Contributing to My Pet Buddy 🐾

Thank you for your interest in contributing to My Pet Buddy! This guide will help you understand how to contribute to this project effectively.

## 📦 What's in this repo

My Pet Buddy ships as **two apps that share the same pet art and animation logic**:

- **Browser extension** (repo root) — pets parade across web pages. Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium browsers.
- **Desktop app** (`desktop/`) — an Electron app where a pet walks across your whole screen, over every app. macOS + Windows.

Both use the same PNG pets in `pets/`, so adding a pet benefits both. Extension contribution is covered first; the Desktop App section near the end covers the Electron app.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Chrome browser for testing
- Git installed on your system
- Image editing software (for pet images)

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nycanshu/my-pet-buddy.git
   cd my-pet-buddy
   ```
3. **Load the extension** in Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder
   - Test the extension to ensure it works

## 🐾 Adding New Pets

### Rules for Adding New Pets

#### 1. **Image Requirements**
- **Format**: PNG only (no JPG, GIF, or other formats)
- **Background**: Must have transparent background (remove background for consistency)
- **Quality**: High resolution, clear, and well-cropped
- **Style**: Consistent with existing pets (cute, friendly, animated-style)

#### 2. **Naming Convention**
- **Existing pet groups**: `<pet-group>-<count>.png`
  - Examples: `cat-7.png`, `dog-8.png`, `bird-7.png`
- **New pet groups**: Follow the same pattern
  - Examples: `fish-1.png`, `turtle-1.png`, `penguin-1.png`

#### 3. **File Structure**
```
pets/
├── cat-1.png through cat-6.png
├── dog-1.png through dog-6.png
├── bird-1.png through bird-6.png
├── hamster-1.png through hamster-6.png
├── rabbit-1.png through rabbit-6.png
└── [your-new-pet]-1.png
```

#### 4. **Code Updates Required**

**For existing pet groups:**
- No code changes needed (automatically detected)

**For new pet groups:**
- Update `PET_TYPES` in `popup.js`:
  ```javascript
  const PET_TYPES = [
      'cat', 'dog', 'bird', 'hamster', 'rabbit',
      'your-new-pet-group'  // Add your new pet group here
  ];
  ```

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Prepare your pet image**:
   - Create/edit your pet image
   - Remove background (make it transparent)
   - Save as PNG format
   - Name it according to the convention

2. **Add the image**:
   - Place the PNG file in the `pets/` folder
   - Follow the naming convention exactly

3. **Update code (if new pet group)**:
   - Open `popup.js`
   - Find the `PET_TYPES` array
   - Add your new pet group name

4. **Test locally**:
   - Reload the extension in Chrome
   - Test that your new pet appears in the popup
   - Verify the pet displays correctly on websites
   - Check that animations work properly

5. **Update documentation**:
   - If adding a new pet group, update this CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Update README.md if needed

## 🚫 What Not to Contribute

### Please Avoid:

- Inappropriate or offensive content
- Non-pet related images
- Breaking existing functionality
- Unnecessary code changes

### Image Guidelines:
- ❌ No JPG or GIF formats
- ❌ No images with solid backgrounds
- ❌ No low-resolution images
- ❌ No copyrighted or trademarked characters
- ✅ PNG format only
- ✅ Transparent background
- ✅ High quality and clear
- ✅ Original or properly licensed content

## 🖥️ Desktop App (Electron)

My Pet Buddy also ships as a desktop app (`desktop/`) that walks a pet across your
whole screen, over any app. It reuses the same pet art and animation logic as the
browser extension.

### Run it locally
```bash
cd desktop
npm install
npm start
```
The pet appears at the bottom of your screen. Control it from the menu-bar (macOS)
or system-tray (Windows) icon: Show/Hide, Settings, Launch at Login, Quit.

### Project layout
- `main.js` — app bootstrap (AppController)
- `src/store/` — settings (electron-store) + defaults
- `src/walker/pacing.js` — pure pacing math (unit-tested)
- `overlay/` — the transparent pet overlay (`PetWalker.js`, reused `pets.js`)
- `settings/` — the settings window (reused extension `popup.html`)
- `src/windows/`, `src/tray/`, `src/system/`, `src/ipc/` — window/tray/OS/IPC managers

### Tests
```bash
cd desktop
npm test        # pacing + settings unit tests
```

### Adding a new pet
Same rules as the **Adding New Pets** section above: add six transparent PNGs
`pets/<species>-1..6.png` at the repo root, then register the species in `pets.js`.
The desktop app copies `pets/` into its bundle automatically, so a new pet shows up
in both the extension and the desktop app.

### Building installers
```bash
cd desktop
npm run dist        # current platform
npm run dist:mac    # universal .dmg (run on macOS)
npm run dist:win    # .exe (run on Windows or CI)
```
Tagged pushes (`v*`) trigger `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`, which builds
the macOS `.dmg` and Windows `.exe` and publishes them to GitHub Releases.
